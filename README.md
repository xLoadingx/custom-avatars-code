CustomAvatars
======================

Overview
--------
CustomAvatars is a RUMBLE VR mod that allows players to upload, download, and apply custom avatar rigs for themselves and others.
It loads in game via MelonLoader, uses the RumbleModdingAPI for player and asset handling, and stores avatar data in a GitHub repository.

Main Features
-------------
- Upload custom avatar AssetBundles to a GitHub repository.
- Download and apply custom rigs for local or remote players.
- Toggle avatars for yourself or other players.
- Audit suspicious activity such as mismatched MasterId uploads or failed uploads.
- Store audit logs remotely under logs/YYYY-MM-DD/UUID.json for review.

Disclaimer
----------
Please do not tamper with the GitHub using the code. It only makes things harder for me and other people.
I do have a system in place to prevent it, but if you go out of your way enough to build the mod without it, then that's just sad.
